    h1 dalia.
    p It's a small shop based in California created by me, Dalia (that's my name). So basically, I've always been really crafty and enjoyed creating things since a young age. 
    p After having a shop dedicated to bracelets and necklaces I began to venture off into making things for something I was really passionate about: music. I started making pins for bands that I liked because it was a cool way to show my love and devotion for that band in a cool and punk rock way ya feel?
    p In an incredible stroke of luck other people thought so too, and they not only started buying pins, they also suggested more for me to design. I got to know more music, and people who are passionate about music and that's more than I could have ver hoped more. 
    p But yeah, that's how Bandshite grew into something way bigger than I could have ever imagined. The best part is that it's still growing, so check out our site, recommend some bands, we can't wait to hear from you!
